## Lohnt sich eine Solaranlage für Ihr Dach?

### Sichere Stromversorgung für die Region.

SCHOENERGIE is building one of the first grid-supporting battery storage parks in continental Europe's distribution grid at the Trier Region Industrial Park (IRT). The storage facility acts as a buffer for the public power grid and stabilizes it. This means that if the grid is overloaded, it absorbs electricity. If more electricity is consumed than generated, it compensates by feeding it back into the grid. In addition to ensuring grid stability and security of supply, it also enables electricity trading.
